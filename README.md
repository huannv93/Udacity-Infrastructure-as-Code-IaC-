# Udacity-Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-

### Project :
In this project, you’ll deploy web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. You will write the code that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Instagram-like app from the ground up. You will begin with deploying the networking components, followed by servers, security roles and software

There will be two parts to this project:

- Diagram: You'll first develop a diagram that you can present as part of your portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.
- Script (Template and Parameters): The second part is to interpret the instructions and create a matching CloudFormation script.




### How to run the supporting material?
You can run the supporting material in two easy steps:
```bash
# Ensure that the AWS CLI is configured before runniing the command below
# Create the network infrastructure
# Check the region in the create.sh file
./create.sh myFirstStack network.yml network-parameters.json
# Create servers
# Change the AMI ID and key-pair name in the servers.yml
